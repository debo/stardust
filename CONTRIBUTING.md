# How to Contribute

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the Stardust Micro Framework repository
2. Create a new branch for each feature or improvement
3. Send a pull request from each feature branch to the **develop** branch

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate feature branches, and to send a
pull request for each branch. This allows me to review and pull in new features or improvements individually.

## Style Guide

All pull requests must adhere to the [PSR-2 standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md).

## Testing

All pull requests must be accompanied by passing tests and complete code coverage. 
The Stardust Micro Framework favours Behat and PhpSpec as testing framework but you can also your PHPUnit.
