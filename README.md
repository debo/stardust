# Stardust

Stardust is what the application of your dreams is made of.

Stardust is the result of my personal journey through the learning and understanding of how Symfony works at its core. It all started from
the [official documentation](http://symfony.com/doc/current/create_framework/index.html) and now aims to be what I think it's the most 
minimalistic and lean version of the Symfony Framework.
              
## Requirements
It's recommended that you use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to use Stardust.

## Getting started with Stardust
To start a new project based on Stardust run this command from the directory you want to install your new Stardust Micro Framework application
```sh
composer create-project stardust/stardust [my-app-name]
```
Replace [my-app-name] with the desired directory name for your new application. 
This will install Stardust and all the required dependencies. Stardust requires PHP 5.6.0 or newer.

You will also want to:

* Point your virtual host document root to your new application's public/ directory.
* Or run the following command inside the just created directory to run test your app
  ```sh
  php -S localhost:[port] -t web web/rewrite.php
  ```
That's it! Now go build something cool.
